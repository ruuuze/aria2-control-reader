# aria2-control-reader
Reads aria2 control files (.aria2 files). Created for a CTF challenge, but made it public since I couldn't find any existing scripts that do this. Hopefully, it will be useful to someone some day!

Rename your aria2 control file to "download.aria2" or change the file name in the last line of the python script before running.
